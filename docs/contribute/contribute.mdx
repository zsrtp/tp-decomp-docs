We gladly accept contributions! If you're interested in helping with this project, please continue to read below. If you have any additional questions, please reach out to us on the [Zelda Decompilation Discord server](https://discord.zelda.deco.mp/)!

## What is needed?

To contribute to this project, you will need:
- A dump of the GameCube USA version of Twilight Princess
- [Ghidra](https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra)
- Basic knowledge about using Git
- Basic knowledge about programming (preferrably in C++ / C)

Deep programming experience is unnecessary. You will learn as-you-go through working on the project.

Experience with PowerPC Assembly code is also not necessary, although helpful. You will not need to write any Assembly code in this project.

A moderately powerful computer will also be beneficial, as building the project can take quite some time.

:::caution Important note
  You will have to **source your own dump of the game**. We **cannot** assist you in acquiring it.

:::caution Windows users
  The documentation here will assume you are using Linux (either native or through WSL). If you are on Windows, we strongly recommend setting up WSL and using it for this project. Native Windows is supported as well, but is not recommended.
