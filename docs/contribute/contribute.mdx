We gladly accept contributions! If you're interested in helping with this project, please continue to read below. If you have any additional questions, please reach out to us on the [Zelda Decompilation Discord server](https://discord.zelda.deco.mp/)!

## What is needed?

To contribute to this project, you will (at minimum) need:
- A dump of the GameCube USA version of Twilight Princess
- [Ghidra](https://github.com/encounter/ghidra-ci/releases)
- Basic knowledge about using Git
- Basic knowledge about programming (preferrably in C++ / C)

Deep programming experience is unnecessary. You will learn as-you-go through working on the project.

Experience with PowerPC Assembly code is also not necessary, although helpful. You will not need to write any Assembly code in this project.

A moderately powerful computer will also be beneficial, as building the project can take quite some time.

:::caution Important note
  You will have to **source your own dump of the game**. We **cannot** assist you in acquiring it.
