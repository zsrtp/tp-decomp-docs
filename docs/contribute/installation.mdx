Follow these steps to set up the project.

## Set Up Dependencies

The following tools will be needed for the project:

* Python 3.10 or newer
* Build-essential tools

If you are using a distribution under Linux or WSL2, you will also need to install either **Wine** or **[WiBo](https://github.com/decompals/wibo)**.

You can install either WiBo or Wine but you should only install one of them. We recommend to install WiBo because it is faster and more lightweight.

If you are on MacOS (only intel-based ones), only install: 

* Wine (Install it with the MacOS step below)

Linux/WSL2:
```shell
sudo apt install build-essential python3
```
And if you chose to install Wine instead of WiBo:
```shell
sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386
```
```shell
sudo apt-get update
```
```shell
sudo apt-get install wine wine32
```

MacOS:
```shell
brew install python
```
```shell
xcode-select --install
```
```shell
brew cask install wine-stable
```

## Setting Up The Repository

1. Clone the repository and switch to it by running:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/zeldaret/tp.git && cd tp 
```

2. Place your copy of GameCube USA Twilight Princess in the root directory and call it `gz2e01.iso`

3. Install the necessary python modules with following command:
```shell
python3 -m pip install --user -r tools/requirements.txt
```

4. Setup the project by executing the following command:
```shell
./tp setup
```

5. Create the Expected directory (for diffing asm functions via diff.py):
```shell
./tp expected
```

## Building
### Building a playable ROM
To build a playable game, run:
```shell
make game
```

:::caution Note
You can add the `-j#` argument where # is the amount of threads your system has in order to greatly speed up build times.
```shell
make game -j8
```
:::

To make use of WiBo (if installed), append the environment variable like:
```shell
make game WINE=wibo
```

### Building the DOL
To build the DOL (main executable), simply run make:
```shell
make
``` 

### Building the RELs
To build the RELs (Relocatable code), add the `rels` parameter:
```shell
make rels
``` 

### Extracting game assets
To extract the game assets (non-code files) from your provided ROM, add the `assets` parameter:

```shell
make assets
``` 

### Cleanup
To delete only your built DOL, add the `clean` parameter:
```shell
make clean
``` 

To delete only the built RELs, add the `clean_rels` parameter:
```shell
make clean_rels
``` 

To delete the built playable ROM, add the `clean_game` parameter:

```shell
make clean_game
``` 

To delete your entire build, add the `clean_all` parameter:

```shell
make clean_all
```
